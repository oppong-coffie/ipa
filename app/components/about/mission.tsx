          IPA-GH’s mission is to foster inclusive and sustainable development by
          empowering marginalized communities through grassroots mobilization.
          We promote social justice and resilience so that diverse populations
          can actively address global challenges like climate change while
          protecting their unique rights and cultural heritage. Youth and
          vulnerable voices are at the center of sustainable development
          discussions.
